PROMPT:

Merge the following answers into a single coherent paragraph. The question asked was: What are some of the most famous findings of particle physics?


VARIOUS ANSWERS:
Subatomic particles: The Standard Model contains 61 elementary particles. These elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. History: The idea that all matter is fundamentally composed of elementary particles dates back to at least the 6th century BC. In the 19th century, John Dalton concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle. Standard Model: The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles. Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the experimental tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery. Experimental laboratories: The world's major particle physics laboratories are Brookhaven National Laboratory, Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, CERN, DESY, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Institute of High Energy Physics, KEK, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Theory: Theoretical particle physics attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments. There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today. One important branch attempts to better understand the Standard Model and its tests. Theorists make quantitative predictions of observables at collider and astronomical experiments, which along with experimental measurements is used to extract the parameters of the Standard Model with less uncertainty. This work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature's building blocks. Another major effort is in model building where model builders develop ideas for what physics may lie beyond the Standard Model (at higher energies or smaller distances). Some of the most famous findings of particle physics include the Higgs boson, supersymmetric particles, and other new physics.
