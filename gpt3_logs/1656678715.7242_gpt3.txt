PROMPT:

Merge the following answers into a single coherent paragraph. The question asked was: What is the difference between a particle and a wave?


VARIOUS ANSWERS:
A particle is a small object that is indivisible and has mass. A wave is a disturbance that travels through a medium, such as water or air. Particles are small, localized objects that have mass and interact with other particles via forces. Waves are disturbances that propagate through space and time, and they can carry energy and momentum. Particles can be described as wave-like objects under certain conditions, and vice versa.
