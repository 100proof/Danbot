PROMPT:

Merge the following answers into a single coherent paragraph. The question asked was: What are the most fundamental particles in the universe?


VARIOUS ANSWERS:
The most fundamental particles in the universe are those that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles. These elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles. Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s. The most fundamental particles in the universe are the ones that make up the Standard Model of particle physics. These include the quarks, leptons, and bosons.
